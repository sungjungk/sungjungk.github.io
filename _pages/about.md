I am currently a Senior Researcher at the Attached Institute of ETRI, where I focus on trustworthy cloud systems, including confidential computing. 
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from KAIST under the supervision of Prof. [Seungwon Shin](https://nss.kaist.ac.kr/?page_id=29). 
Previously, I interned at Samsung Electronics as a Software Engineer. 
I was also a recipient of the Samsung Electronics Semiconductor Scholarship.
