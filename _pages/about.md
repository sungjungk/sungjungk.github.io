I am a Ph.D student at KAIST, and I am currently a senior researcher at the Attached Institute of ETRI. 
Prior to that, I was a researcher at TmaxSoft for alternative service as mandatory military service duty. 
Also, I interned at Samsung Electronics as a Software Engineer. 
I was a recipient of the Samsung Electronics Semiconductor Scholarship.

My research interests are all aspects of computer security with a current focus on system security for cloud infrastructure.
