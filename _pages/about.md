I am a member of research staff at Attached Institute of ETRI. 
Prior to that, I was a researcher at TmaxSoft R&D Center for alternative service as mandatory military service duty. 
Also, I interned at Samsung Electronics in the capacity of a Software Engineer. 
I am also a recipient of the Samsung Electronics Scholarship.

My research interests are all aspects of computer security with a current focus on making Linux distributions more secure.
